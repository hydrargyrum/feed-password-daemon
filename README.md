# feed-password-daemon

When run, feed-password-daemon:
- takes as arguments: a command that will be wrapped and its arguments
- takes a password on stdin and caches it
- run this forever:
    - waits for SIGUSR1 to be received
    - when SIGUSR1 is received, it runs the wrapped command
    - waits for a password prompt coming from the wrapped command
    - feeds the cached password to the wrapped command

## But why?

Here's an example, concrete use case:
[vdirsyncer](https://vdirsyncer.pimutils.org/en/stable/index.html) and [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net) can both perform periodic remote calendar synchronization (thanks to CalDAV) which is often password-protected.
However:
- being a GUI app, Thunderbird stays open, reads the password at start and caches it in RAM, so it can use the password when needed, without asking it again
- being a command-line, non-TUI app, vdirsyncer has no means to cache the password and is forced to ask it at every sync (possibly delegating to [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org), but the problem still stands)

This is where feed-password-daemon helps: it will cache the CalDAV password and wrap vdirsyncer to run it when desired and feeds it the password, without asking it again, Ã  la Thunderbird.
